                    Campus Cravings strives to provide tasty and convenient desserts that can be made anywhere with just a microwave and a mug to the students at the University of South Carolina. Our subscription-style service offers boxes of single serve, "just-add-water" dessert mixes. Our boxes come in sizes of 6, 13, or 24 packets of dessert mix packaged in completely eco-friendly material. Orders can be placed right through the Campus Cravings website whether as a guest or a returning user, making it easier than ever to send a reminder to your student that you're thinking of them.

                    Our goal is to not only fulfill the sweet tooth of the students at the University of South Carolina but also our duty to Planet Earth. As a business, we want to do our part in maintaining the health of our planet and more. Our products are carefully formulated to be both easy to prepare and easy on the environment, using strictly eco-friendly and recyclable materials in all of our packaging. After getting our footing down in Columbia, we hope to expand our business and bring delicious desserts to more college students at campuses all across the country.
